        "- Maintain conversational context over multiple user turns.\n",
        "- Respond helpfully and accurately to a wide range of user inputs.\n",
        "- Reason about user intent before generating each response.\n",
        "- Politely ask clarifying questions if a request is ambiguous or unclear.\n",

        "    \"What is a Python list?\": \"A Python list is a mutable, ordered sequence of items. It can hold items of different data types and is defined by enclosing elements in square brackets, e.g., `[1, 'hello', 3.14]`.\",\n",
        "    \"What is a Python tuple?\": \"A Python tuple is an immutable, ordered sequence of items. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed after creation and are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses, e.g., `(1, 'hello', 3.14)`.\",\n",
        "    \"What is a Python dictionary?\": \"A Python dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is mutable and optimized for retrieving values when the key is known. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces, e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`.\",\n",
        "    \"How do you define a function in Python?\": \"In Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters, and a colon. The function body is indented below this line. For example: `def my_function(param1):`.\"\n",
